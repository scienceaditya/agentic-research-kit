# AI involvement

This project was developed with AI assistance. This page is here for transparency and to set expectations about what is and is not included in this public companion repo.

## What was human-driven

- The topic selection and overall direction were human-chosen.
- A small set of seed papers from the literature were provided up front.

## What AI helped with

- Literature review: summarizing papers, identifying themes, and surfacing gaps to investigate.
- Experiment planning: proposing experiments and feasibility considerations.
- Writing: drafting text that was then reviewed and edited.

## Human oversight

Humans reviewed and edited the AI-generated content for scientific consistency and to remove unsupported claims. Humans also decided which proposed ideas were worth keeping.

## What this repo does not claim

- No new experiments were executed as part of the Agents4Science writeup.
- No novel datasets are released here.
- This repo is a concept note and planning framework, not a results paper.

## Limitations observed when using AI

- When given too much starting information, AI can lose focus.
- When the literature evidence is weak or mixed, the output can become noisy.
- Experiment suggestions can be expensive or labor-intensive relative to the expected payoff.

A practical takeaway is to apply stronger feasibility filters earlier and to prioritize cheap pilot versions of ambitious experiments.
